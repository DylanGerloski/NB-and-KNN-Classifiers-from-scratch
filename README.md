Features
  
Allows you to run a csv file and test the accuracy of each classifier by using cross-fold validation. 

Accepts any numeric csv file with classes of either yes or no. You may also use the pima.csv and folds.csv files that I have given.

If you have your own csv file that meets the above criteria, the program can also create a new fold file with the name folds.csv.

The main function is located in MyClassifier.java
